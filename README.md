# AtomicChar

Word wrap for non-monospace fonts, including Asian ones. Atom package page is [here](https://atom.io/packages/atomicchar).

Inspired by [japanese-wrap](https://atom.io/packages/japanese-wrap).


## Install this package manually

I got an error when I was trying to install this package in the Atom's Settings page. And it's [an issue](https://github.com/atom/settings-view/issues/577). I installed the package [manually](https://discuss.atom.io/t/manually-install-package/9251), and it works fine for me.
